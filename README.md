Project Overview 
In this project, I developed an intelligent agent capable of navigating a maze-like treasure hunt environment using deep Q-learning. The goal of the agent was to locate the treasure before the human 
player by learning an optimal path through reinforcement learning. 

The starter code provided a pre-built environment that defined the maze structure, movement rules, and reward system. It also included a neural network model template and partial training logic. The provided
code handled environment setup, action spaces, and basic reinforcement learning structure. However, I was responsible for implementing and refining the deep Q-learning algorithm. This included configuring the
neural network architecture, tuning hyperparameters such as epsilon (exploration rate), implementing experience replay, updating the target network, and managing the training loop. I also tested multiple
configurations to evaluate convergence behavior and agent performance.

Through experimentation, I learned how reward shaping, exploration decay, and training epochs influence an agent’s learning efficiency. Observing how small adjustments dramatically changed training outcomes
reinforced the importance of careful parameter tuning in reinforcement learning systems.

Connecting My Learning to Computer Science 
Computer scientists design algorithms, build systems, and create intelligent solutions to solve complex real-world problems. In this project, I applied reinforcement learning techniques to simulate intelligent decision-
making in a game environment. This reflects a broader responsibility of computer scientists: creating systems that can learn, adapt, and improve over time.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning have applications far beyond games, including robotics, healthcare diagnostics, financial modeling, and cybersecurity. The ability to design systems that learn from
data is increasingly critical in modern computing. This project demonstrated how theoretical concepts like Q-learning, neural networks, and policy optimization translate into practical implementations.

How I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist 
Throughout this course, I learned that solving problems as a computer scientist requires structured thinking, experimentation, and iteration. I begin by clearly defining the problem and understanding constraints. In this
case, the problem was pathfinding under uncertainty with a learning-based agent.

Next, I break the system into components: environment representation, action space, reward structure, model architecture, and training logic. Rather than trying to solve everything at once, I isolate issues—such
as poor convergence or unstable learning—and adjust one parameter at a time.

Reinforcement learning particularly reinforced the importance of testing and debugging through observation. Watching the win history, monitoring epsilon decay, and analyzing training curves allowed me
to make data-driven decisions. This iterative approach mirrors real-world software development, where continuous testing and refinement are essential.

Ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization 
As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities both to users and to the organizations I work for. Intelligent systems must be reliable, transparent, and designed with fairness in mind. While this project
focused on a game agent, the same reinforcement learning techniques are used in recommendation systems, automated decision-making, and adaptive control systems.

It is my responsibility to ensure that AI systems do not cause unintended harm, reinforce bias, or operate unpredictably in high-stakes environments. Additionally, I must document my work clearly and write
maintainable, understandable code so others can evaluate and improve upon it.

This project reinforced the importance of understanding not only how algorithms work, but also how they impact the systems in which they are deployed.

Final Reflection 
This pirate intelligent agent project represents my ability to implement reinforcement learning concepts from theory to practice. I applied deep Q-learning, neural networks, experience replay, and target network
stabilization to train an agent capable of solving a dynamic pathfinding problem.

More importantly, this project strengthened my understanding of how machine learning integrates into broader computer science principles: algorithm design, experimentation, optimization, and ethical
responsibility. It demonstrates my ability to work with AI systems and contributes to my growing portfolio as I prepare for a professional career in software engineering and intelligent systems development.
